description: Use this skill whenever porting MOM6 (Modular Ocean Model 6) Fortran code to run on GPU, or reviewing/debugging existing GPU-offloaded MOM6 code. This covers converting loops to `do concurrent` or OpenMP `!$omp target` offload directives, deciding where `!$omp target enter/exit data` and `target update` directives belong, handling MOM6 control-structure (`*_CS`) fields and derived types like `tv`/`G`/`US`/`GV` on the device, working around the MOM_EOS polymorphic-type GPU limitation, blocking/tiling a `jki`-ordered loop (`njblock`/`niblock`, à la `MOM_continuity_PPM.F90`) or k-blocking a `kji`-ordered loop with no k-recurrence (`nkblock`, `k_start`/`k_end`, collapsing `k` into `do concurrent`, à la `MOM_hor_visc.F90`) as prep before offload, and preserving CPU performance while adding GPU support (e.g. loop tiling / "blocks"). Trigger this for tasks like "port this subroutine to GPU", "add OpenMP offload to this loop", "block/tile this jki loop", "k-block this loop", "port this kji loop to GPU", "why does this only break when NKBLOCK>1", "why is this GPU kernel giving different answers than the CPU", "how should I map this CS field to the device", or any work touching `!$omp target`, `do concurrent`, loop blocking, or GPU offload anywhere in the MOM6 codebase — even if the user doesn't use the word "skill" or spell out these directive names explicitly.

# MOM6 GPU Loop Porting

## Status and scope

MOM6's GPU port is a work in progress, validated only on the`double_gyre`,
`benchmark` and `benchmark_ALE` configurations — the codebase is large, and
only the paths those configurations exercise are ported so far. Treat
everything below as current best practice, not a finished spec: for a pattern
not covered here, make a reasonable call consistent with this philosophy, flag
it to the user, and suggest adding it once confirmed to work.

Overall approach: compute on GPU via `do concurrent` or OpenMP `target`
loop constructs, manage data movement explicitly (never rely on
compiler-inferred transfers), and port only the branches the target
configurations exercise.

## Before porting any loop: check for MOM_EOS calls

GPUs can't execute a polymorphic Fortran type's deferred procedures from
inside a kernel — `MOM_EOS` subroutines are typically dispatched this way
(an abstract `EOS` type selecting the equation-of-state routine at
runtime). This doesn't make MOM_EOS-adjacent code unportable: a kernel can
launch inside an EOS subroutine on data already resident on device, as
long as *that subroutine's own kernels* never touch the polymorphic `EOS`
type internally. The constraint is the dispatch happening inside a kernel,
not EOS logic being off-limits.

Before converting a loop:

1. Check whether the loop body calls a MOM_EOS subroutine.
2. If it does, check whether it separates cleanly from the rest of the
   loop (hoisted out, or called ahead into a temporary array) without
   substantially restructuring the surrounding code.
3. If separation is easy, do it, and port the surrounding loop normally.
4. If separation isn't easy — a real refactor is needed — **stop**. Don't
   attempt the port. Explain to the user why the EOS call blocks a
   straightforward port, sketch 1-2 refactor approaches, and ask how
   they'd like to proceed before writing offload code. Guessing risks a
   kernel that won't compile, crashes on device, or an unwanted refactor.

## Choosing a loop construct

Try these in order. Each fallback exists to solve a specific, concrete
problem with the option above it, not out of general preference — don't
skip to a fallback unless its trigger actually applies.

### 1. `do concurrent` (default choice)

`do concurrent` is preferred by default: it's standard Fortran, so code
stays portable and readable off-GPU too, and it currently gets the best
`nvfortran` code generation (the compiler this port targets).

```fortran
do concurrent( j=js:je, i=is:ie ) DO_LOCALITY(local(tmp))
  tmp = some_expression(i, j)
  output(i,j) = tmp * other_array(i,j)
enddo
```

Notes on `do concurrent` syntax, since it differs from an ordinary `do` loop
in easy-to-miss ways:

- Loop bounds are separated by a **colon**, not a comma:
  `do concurrent( i = is:ie, j = js:je )` — not `do i=is,ie; do j=js,je`.
- Collapse multi-dimensional loops into a single `do concurrent` statement
  instead of nesting separate `do concurrent` loops per dimension. Nesting
  one `do concurrent` inside another is fine (e.g. an outer 2-D horizontal
  loop with an inner k-loop that itself needs to be a `do concurrent`) —
  avoid only splitting one multi-index statement into several nested ones.
- Declare loop-private scalar temporaries with `local(tmp)` so GPU
  parallelization doesn't race on them; accumulate a scalar reduction
  (e.g. a logical-or "did any column still need work" flag) with
  `reduce(.or.:some_flag)` the same way.
- **Always wrap the locality clause in the `DO_LOCALITY(...)` macro**
  (`#include`d from `src/framework/do_concurrent_compat.h`), never bare:
  `DO_LOCALITY(local(tmp))`, `DO_LOCALITY(reduce(.or.:do_any))`.
  `MOM_continuity_PPM.F90` — this pattern's reference file — never writes a
  bare clause. The macro expands to the clause only when
  `HAVE_FC_DO_CONCURRENT_LOCAL` is defined, else to nothing, so the same
  source stays portable to compilers without locality-specifier support;
  writing the clause directly silently drops that fallback.
- Remove any pre-existing `!$OMP parallel do` directive when converting a
  loop to `do concurrent` — the two shouldn't coexist on the same loop.
- `do concurrent` supports a mask condition, which is a natural fit for the
  common MOM6 pattern of `do i; do j; if (mask(i,j) > 0) ...`:

  ```fortran
  do concurrent( j=js:je, i=is:ie, mask(i,j) > 0 )
    output(i,j) = some_expression(i,j)
  enddo
  ```

  Prefer this masked form over an `if` as the loop body's first statement
  when the condition simply gates whether the iteration runs at all.

**The one case `do concurrent` can't be used**: a loop needing to
privatize an *automatic array* per thread (an array-valued temporary sized
from loop or subroutine bounds, unlike the scalar temporaries `local(...)`
is meant for). As of `nvfortran` 26.5 there's a known compiler bug here —
don't fight it, fall through to the next construct. Since it's a live bug,
check whether a newer `nvfortran` release has fixed it before reflexively
falling back, in case this exception has gone stale.

**`do concurrent` also can't contain a call to a non-`pure` procedure, or
safely collapse a dimension with a genuine cross-iteration dependency.**
Check every loop body for (a) calls to subroutines/functions that aren't
`pure`, and (b) anything accumulated *across* iterations of the dimension
being folded in, rather than freshly computed per-iteration. Either one
means that dimension must stay an ordinary sequential `do` instead of
joining the `do concurrent` index set — unless the accumulation can be
expressed as a `DO_LOCALITY(reduce(...))` clause, which puts it back on the
table. This comes up most often when collapsing a layer dimension (`k`)
that used to be a separate sequential loop into the same `do concurrent` as
`j`/`i` — see `references/kji-loop-blocking-guide.md` for a worked example
(`MOM_hor_visc.F90`'s MEKE-reduction loops kept a serial step for this).

### 2. `!$omp target teams loop collapse(n)` (fallback for automatic-array privatization)

When `do concurrent` isn't usable because of the automatic-array
privatization issue above, use `!$omp target teams loop` instead, with
`collapse(n)` for the `n` parallel loop levels:

```fortran
!$omp target teams loop collapse(2)
do j=js,je ; do i=is,ie
  ! loop body, including whatever needed the automatic array
enddo ; enddo
```

This is the preferred OpenMP fallback over the option below, based on how
it performs with `nvfortran` in practice.

### 3. `!$omp target distribute parallel do collapse(n)` (fallback for when `target teams loop` fails)

If `target teams loop` itself fails to compile or run correctly for a
given loop (e.g. a compiler bug unrelated to the automatic-array issue),
`!$omp target distribute parallel do collapse(n)` has worked as a
substitute in some cases:

```fortran
!$omp target distribute parallel do collapse(2)
do j=js,je ; do i=is,ie
  ! loop body
enddo ; enddo
```

Reach for this only after `target teams loop` has actually been tried and
shown to fail — it's a second-line fallback, not an alternative default.

## Data mapping: what's already resident, and what you must map yourself

Two large derived types worth knowing about up front:

- **`G` (grid), `US` (unit scaling), `GV` (vertical grid)** and their
  constituent arrays can be assumed already resident on device everywhere
  in the model, unless told otherwise for a specific case. You generally
  don't need mapping directives for these.
- **`tv` (thermodynamic variables)**, by contrast, is *not* yet
  persistently resident. Any subroutine touching `tv` or its constituent
  arrays (e.g. `tv%S`, `tv%T`) needs them explicitly mapped to device from
  outside the subroutine that uses them.

When mapping a derived type like `tv`, order matters as it does for
`*_CS` structs (see `references/data-mapping-conventions.md`, Rule 2): map
the parent type first, then its constituent arrays.

**The gotcha that has caused segfaults in practice**: once a constituent
array is mapped back with its own `target update from(...)` (because a
subroutine modified it), do **not** subsequently re-map the *parent type*
`tv` itself. Doing so afterward can clobber the arrays' host contents, or
leave them pointing at a device address that no longer exists — a
segfault or accelerator failure, not usually a silent wrong-answer bug, so
it's easy to miss until a run crashes. If only the arrays changed, map
only the arrays back.

For the four rules governing *where in the code* a mapping directive belongs
(subroutine-local temporaries, static vs. dynamic `*_CS` fields, and
subroutine argument arrays), see `references/data-mapping-conventions.md`.

## Preserving CPU and GPU performance together

A port is only useful if it (a) doesn't change answers relative to the CPU
path, (b) doesn't change answers relative to `dev/gpu`, our development
branch, and (c) doesn't slow the CPU path down. All three matter equally —
a numerically-correct port that regresses CPU performance is unacceptable,
and so is a fast GPU kernel that quietly reorders a summation (see the
arithmetic-reproducibility notes in `references/code-style-guide.md` — a
common way for (a)/(b) to fail silently).

**Loop tiling ("blocks") is the main tool for satisfying (c) without
sacrificing GPU throughput.** The idea: keep the same tile/block size on
both platforms, but choose different sizes per platform — cache-friendly
on CPU (often the default block size in `i`, size 1 in `j` and `k`), large
on GPU (often the whole default-sized 3-D array as one block, to maximize
parallel work per kernel launch). `MOM_continuity_PPM.F90` and
`MOM_CoriolisAdv.F90` are already ported this way and are good references
for how the tiling is structured.

See `references/loop-blocking-shared-patterns.md` for the commit
discipline, common pitfalls, and runtime-configurable block-size pattern
shared by both directions of blocking; the two paragraphs below cover what's
specific to each loop shape.

If the loop you're porting is `jki`-ordered (a `k`-recurrence, so only
`j`/`i` can be blocked) and isn't tiled yet, do that restructuring *first*,
as its own bisectable pass, before adding any offload directive — see
`references/loop-blocking-guide.md` for the step-by-step recipe
(introducing `njblock`/`niblock`, batching a per-row `MOM_EOS` call to its
2-D interface, and the shape-specific gotchas found).

If instead the loop is `kji`-ordered — each vertical layer's calculation is
independent, with no `k-1`/`k+1` recurrence — `k` itself can be blocked
*and* collapsed into the same `do concurrent` as `j`/`i`, rather than just
looped over sequentially outside it. See
`references/kji-loop-blocking-guide.md` for the k-blocking recipe
(`nkblock`, `k_start`/`k_end`, collapsing `k` into the parallel index set)
and the shape-specific gotchas found blocking `MOM_hor_visc.F90`'s
`horizontal_viscosity` this way.

**If a subroutine or module looks like it needs a substantial refactor to
get CPU and GPU performance to coexist** (not just a loop-construct swap),
don't push through it solo. Explain to the user why a refactor looks
necessary, sketch a couple of approaches, and ask how they'd like to
proceed — the same escalation pattern as the MOM_EOS case above.

## Blocking a loop: shared patterns and gotchas

The `jki` and `kji` blocking recipes (`references/loop-blocking-guide.md`,
`references/kji-loop-blocking-guide.md`) share the same commit discipline
and hit some of the same failure modes, regardless of which dimension gets
blocked. See `references/loop-blocking-shared-patterns.md` for that shared
material — commit discipline, the block-size-1-insufficient gotcha, the
`if(k==1)`-guarded-init race, the runtime-configurable-block-size pattern,
and how to diagnose a hang during a blocking pass. Each loop-shape guide
covers only what's specific to its own shape.

## Verifying a port

Before considering a port done:

- **Correctness (a and b above)**: compare the `ocean.stats` file from a
  run with the port against one without it (or from `dev/gpu`). They
  should match. If they don't, suspect a reordered reduction, a
  mapping-order bug (see the `tv` gotcha above), or a race from a missing
  `local(...)` clause before looking elsewhere.
- **Performance (c above)**: check this with the CPU clocks already built
  into `MOM_cpu_clock` — see `references/performance-timing.md` for how to
  find an existing clock for the component you're porting, or add one if
  it doesn't exist. Separately, a scripts directory is intended for
  testing target configurations against target compiler settings for
  broader performance regressions. It may not be populated yet — check
  whether it exists and has usable scripts before assuming it's available,
  and ask the user if you can't find it.
